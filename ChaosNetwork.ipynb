    "# Understanding the depth in deep learning through the lense of chaos theory\n",

    "The age of machines has dawned with promise to understand all physical and human phenomenon by employing intelligent machines. These machines harvest a repertoire of neurons that encode the mechanisms of these systems and thus faithfully represent the system itself. These promises to impart us premonition capabilities and help make intelligent decisions. The forerunner among all such artificially intelligent systems are deep neural network. [MIT technology](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513696/deep-learning/) review is listed it as most disruptive technology in the 21st century. The process of creation of such artificial neural network has been termed as *deep learning*. The term *deep* in deep learning refers to multiple layers of neuron ensemble stacked one after the other. Conversely, a shallow network is neural network with just one layer between the input and the output. The cognitive abilities of deep neural network has been attributed to it's depth. This post uncovers some of the mysteries behind the role of depth in imparting such abilities.\n",

    "## A brief history of chaos theory\n",
    "The story of depth is intimately interlinked with the story of chaos theory and begins in the decade of 60s when Edward Lorenz, a physicist at MIT atmospheric sciences, discovered that *time evolution* of the states for a model for atmospheric dynamics shows extreme sensitivity to the initial condition (starting point). *We will understand later that how __time evolution__ is connected to __depth__ in a feedforward neural network*. Thus if you start at a point with decimal points difference from another point you will end up at a complete different point after some time. This phenomenon is also known as *butterfly effect*.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the picture above, the future position of the moving ball is extremely sensitive to it's starting point. Move the initial point of the ball a tinge and it will end at a completely different place on the butterfly wings after only few time steps. \n",

    "\n",
    "This is also illustrated in the picture above. The blue cone and the yellow are initialliy co-located differing only by $10^{-5}$ in the $x$-coordinate. After only 30 time steps, they end up at completely different position. This exponential divergence of trajectories is one of the fundamental property of a chaotic dynamical system. The more chaotic the system, the more rapidly the trajectories will diverge. This is quantified in terms of [*Lyapunov exponent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent). We will revisit this figure later in this post. Lets call this **Figure 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Side note -- the long term collection of states over which the system evolves is termed as *attractor* and the dynamics is *ergodic* on the attractor. *Markov chain Monte Carlo* algorithm which is used to sample a probability distribution constructs a Markov chain whose *attractor* is *ergodic* on the joint distribution which we want to sample.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enter neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "Can a neural network be chaotic? The answer is an emphatic yes. But wait, what does it even mean for a neural network to be chaotic? Let us first understand what is a neural network. The neural network is collection of neurons. Each of these neuron has their own state. The $x$, $y$ and $z$ variables in Lorenz system could for example represent the state of neural network with just 3 neurons. The states of the neuron can evolve time wise like in Lorenz system. In a dynamical system like Lorenz, the next state is a function of the current state. This is known as [*Markov property*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property).\n",
    "\n",
    "So here we come to core idea -- **the next state in time is analogous to the state of the next layer in a deep network**.\n",

    "\n",
    "The figure above shows a feedforward network with two hidden layers. The states of 4 neurons in the *hidden layer 1* feed as input to the *hidden layer 2* and is instrumental in determining the states of 4 neurons in the *hidden layer 2*. **_One can also think of layer 2 as the next state in time of layer 1 and layer 3 as the next state in time of layer 2 and so on ....._** Now what happens if each layer is chaotic? *Very small changes in the state of layer 1 would result in a completely different state of layer 2!* Similarly, a small change in the input will result in completely different state of layer 1. We will understand later why this is a desirable thing and how it helps us model complex systems.\n",

    "### A statistical physics magic\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/files/Desktop/ChaosRNN.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1988 work by Sompolinsky et al published in PRL showed that a sufficiently large sized neural network can indeed become chaotic if it's parameters are carefully tuned. They employed a certain statistical physics magic known as mean field approximation to show that a large sized network can become chaotic in a particular parameter regime. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why make it deep?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even a neural network with a single layer is a [universal function approximator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem). This means that in theory atleast they can be used to model any system. So then why make it deep? Let's understand how depth imparts greater modeling ability with lesser resources. \n",

    "Consider two input data points represented by the red star and blue star in the figure above. Although they are very very close in the input space, they have have very different correlation with the output. For instance, these two data points could belong to two different classes. There could be many such spots on our data manifold where nearby points map to completely different regions in the output space. A neural network is supposed to comprehend this and separate them. Now let's thhink of single layer network. We could in principle model this just using a single layer with very large number of neurons. The network should be able separate the red and blue star in a manner similar to separating the two nearby trajectories, differing only by $10^{-5}$ in **Figure 1**. Remember the blue cone and the yellow cone in **Figure 1** showed visible separation only after 30 time steps.  They are still indistinguishable from each other after only 1 time step. Thus, even if we somehow achieve a large *Lyapunov exponent*, there is a limit to how much we can separate in a single time step or analogously a single layer. \n",
    "Now what we if increase the *depth* of the network and stack multiple layers in front of each other. The beam of input diverge as they pass through each chaotic lens and we can see a clear separation in the final projection on the screen of output. This has been illustrated in the figure above. This is similar to the blue cone and the yellow cone having clear separation after 30 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is another big idea -- *training of deep neural network involves tuning parameters so that each layer is chaotic or nearly chaotic.*"
